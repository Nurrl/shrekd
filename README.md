# shrt
SHare and shoRTen, simple file &amp; url sharing service

# Feature ideas
- Shared slugs between redirects and files
- User-programmable:
    - [ ] Slug length
    - [x] Expiry date (see if we need to add duration instead)
    - [x] Download count
    - [ ] Custom Slug
    - [ ] Checksum verification
- Allow pastes
- Delete token
- Retention curve depending on the weight, with expiration in return headers
